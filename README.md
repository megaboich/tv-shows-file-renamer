# tv-shows-file-renamer

CLI tool to automatically rename and group files for TV series.

Main functionality:

- Extract series metadata from [thetvdb.com](thetvdb.com) API.
- Group episodes by Season folders.
- Automatically change subtitles encoding to UTF-8 from specified encoding.
- Build filenames which are easily recognizable by [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) mediaserver

So, if you have bunch of files named like this:

```
üé¨ 150.mkv
üìù 150.eng.srt
üé¨ S09E11 - ONEPIECE - 153.mkv
üé¨ [CoolSubsTeam] - 196 - OnePiece.mkv
```

The tool provides a fast way to get this:

```
üìÅ Season 09
    üé¨ S09E007 - 150 - Dreams Don't Come True! Bellamy vs. The Saruyama Alliance.mkv
    üìù S09E007 - 150 - Dreams Don't Come True! Bellamy vs. The Saruyama Alliance.eng.srt

| -s  | serie identificator   | This is a serie identificator used by [thetvdb.com](thetvdb.com) API. To get it you need to locate you serie on the [thetvdb.com](thetvdb.com) website and copy part of URL. <br/> For example for this url: `https://www.thetvdb.com/series/one-piece` the serie id is `one-piece` | `-s one-piece` |
| -d  | dry run mode          | You can check expected output but without actual performing any operations on disk. Useful when you are not sure about whether metadata are correct.                                                                                                                                | `-d`           |
| -m  | only extract metadata | Does not perform any operations with you series, only downloads metadata for given serie from [thetvdb.com](thetvdb.com) API and saves that to `META.json` file.                                                                                                                    | `-m`           |
| -e  | encode subtitles      | Performs re-encoding of `*.srt` files from specified encoding to **UTF-8**                                                                                                                                                                                                          | `-e cp1251`    |
